# What is plot.ly? A package to create interactive graphics. It uses the htmlwidget framework, and is compatible with lots of different programs.

# install.packages("plotly")

library(plotly)


plot_ly(z = ~volcano)

d <- mpg

#Two main ways to get a plotly object.

#plot_ly() transforms data into the object.



#ggplotly() turns ggplot object into plotly object.

#Here's our original first ggplot. 
p1 <- ggplot(data=d,
             mapping = aes(x=displ, y=cty)) + geom_point()
p1

#Now, if we use plotly:
ggplotly(p1) #can mouse over and see what exactly each point is

#Annotations can be added using point and click interface

```
